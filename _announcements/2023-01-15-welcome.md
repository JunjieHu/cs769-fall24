---

We are excited to welcome you to the Spring 2023 offering of CS 769 class!

A few organizational moments:
- **Lectures.**
  This year, we offer an in-class instruction of the course with an additional option to join on [Zoom](https://uwmadison.zoom.us/j/95113800299).
  For students joined online, the lectures will be live-streamed and recorded.
  You can find the links to all materials, including slides and video streams, on [the schedule](http://junjiehu.github.io/cs769-spring23/lectures/) page.
- **Logistics.**
  Please make sure to familiarize yourself with the [class logistics](http://junjiehu.github.io/cs769-spring23/logistics/).
- **Homework assignments and projects.**
  Release and due dates for homework assignments and project milestones are reflected in the [schedule](http://junjiehu.github.io/cs769-spring23/lectures/) (announcements will be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kykntsenzmc30o){:target="\_blank"}).
  All the relevant information will also appear on the [homework](http://junjiehu.github.io/cs769-spring23/homework/) page.

We are looking forward to a productive semester working with you!
